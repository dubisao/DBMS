\section{Introduction}
The process of detecting anomalies, patterns, and correlations within massive databases in order to forecast future outcomes is known as data mining. This is accomplished by combining three fields that are intertwined: statistics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Data mining is an automated technique that involves looking for patterns in vast information that humans might miss.


Data mining approaches, for example, are used in weather forecasting. Weather forecasting involves analysing large amounts of past data to find trends and forecast future weather conditions based on the time of year, climate, and other factors.



As a result of this analysis, algorithms or models are developed that collect and analyse data in order to anticipate outcomes with increasing accuracy.
\section{Data Mining Techniques}
To turn enormous amounts of data into meaningful information, data mining employs a variety of algorithms and methodologies. Here are a few of the most popular:

1.Association Rules: The term "association rule" refers to a rule-based method for determining associations between variables in a dataset.  linkages between different items, typically employs these methodologies. Businesses may develop stronger cross-selling strategies and recommendation engines by understanding their customers' consumption habits.

2. Neural Networks: Neural networks, which are mostly used for deep learning algorithms, analyse training data by simulating the interconnection of the human brain through layers of nodes. Inputs, weights, a bias (or threshold), and an output make up each node. If the output value reaches a certain threshold, the node "fires" or "activates," sending data to the network's next layer. Through supervised learning, neural networks learn this mapping function, then alter it based on the loss function using gradient descent. We can be sure in the model's accuracy to produce the correct answer when the cost function is at or near zero.
